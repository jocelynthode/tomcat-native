  Preface

   This is the Changelog for Tomcat Native 1.2.

  Changes in 1.2.5

     * Update: Enable OpenSSL version check in configure by default. It can
       be turned off using --disable-openssl-version-check. (rjung)
     * Fix: 59024: Native function versionString() and for OpenSSL 1.1.0 also
       version() (both in in ssl.c) now return the OpenSSL run time version,
       not the compile time version. (rjung)
     * Code: Track changes in the OpenSSL master branch so it is possible to
       build Tomcat Native with that branch. (billbarker)

  Changes in 1.2.4

     * Fix: SSL.getHandshakeCount(), which was unused, now returns the
       handshake completed count rather than the handshake started count.
       (remm)

  Changes in 1.2.3

     * Fix: Remove Java classes that do not have C implementation code for
       their native methods in the current library. They were used for NPN
       support which is superseded by ALPN support in the current code.
       (kkolinko)
     * Fix: Fix typo in declaration of a stub method used when the library is
       compiled without OpenSSL support. (kkolinko)
     * Fix: Fix the signature of the implementation of the native SSL method
       newSSL() in the case when OPENSSL is not available. (rjung)
     * Fix: Fix the signature of the implementation of the native SSLSocket
       method getInfoB() to return jbyteArray instead of jobject. This is
       consistent with what it actually returns and how the native Java
       method is declared. (rjung)
     * Add: Add support for using Java keystores for certificates and keys.
       (jfclere)
     * Code: Remove code that performs a read after a renegotiation that
       appears to be unnecessary with OpenSSL 1.0.2. (billbarker)
     * Add: Expose SSL_renegotiate to the Java API. (remm)

  Changes in 1.2.2

     * Fix: Fix broken debug and maintainer mode build. (rjung)
     * Fix: Forward port additional fixes to the OpenSSL I/O to align it with
       non-OpenSSL I/O. (markt)

  Changes in 1.2.1

     * Fix: 58566: Enable Tomcat Native 1.2.x to work with Tomcat releases
       that do not have the necessary Java code to support SNI. (markt)
     * Update: Minor rework of "buildconf" script. (rjung)
     * Fix: Fix APR dependency version expression in RPM spec file. (rjung)
     * Fix: Fix major library version number in Windows build files, RPM spec
       file and build description. (rjung)
     * Fix: Remove files "KEYS" and "download_deps.sh" from Windows (zip)
       source distribution. (rjung)
     * Fix: Fix "unused variable" compiler warning. (rjung)

  Changes in 1.2.0

     * Add: Add support for TLS extension ALPN. (markt)
     * Add: Add support for TLS extension SNI (Server Name Indication).
       (markt)
     * Add: Add support for OpenSSL BIO. (jfclere)
     * Add: Support wakeable pollsets and add Poll.interrupt() API. (mturk)
     * Add: Add Pool.unmanaged() API. (mturk)
     * Update: APIs SSL.generateRSATempKey() and SSL.loadDSATempKey() have
       been removed. (rjung)
     * Update: The minimum required APR version is 1.4.3.
     * Update: The minimum required OpenSSL version is 1.0.2.
